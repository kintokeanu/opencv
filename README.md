Home.py
This code initializes the camera and display screen, then captures and displays images in a loop until the program is terminated. The images are captured using OpenCV and converted to a Pygame surface, which is then displayed on the screen using Pygame.

Button.py
This code sets up a button input using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins and checks the state of the button in a loop. If the button is pressed, the camera's images are displayed on the screen. If the button is not pressed, the screen is cleared.
